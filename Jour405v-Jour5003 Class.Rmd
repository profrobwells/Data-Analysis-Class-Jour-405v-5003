## Week #3: R: Scripts, Workbooks, Markdown. GitHub


#GitHub

This class is intended to teach you modern workflow techniques for coding. A centerpiece of that workflow is GitHub. This is a website with a system that allows you to collaborate with other programmers on coding projects. It manages versions of software code and is a very popular with the tech elite. 

Your GitHub account, which is public, represents an important professional image. Prospective employers and collaborators will look at your GitHub account.

--Create a GitHub account.

## Download R and RStudio

This program is loaded on all of the computers in Kimpel 146. You can load it on your laptop as well. It is not large and doesn't tax the memory a lot. R runs on Windows, Mac and Linux, but this course uses the Mac version. If you use Windows on your personal laptop, the instructor is not responsible for any variations in the lessons and instructions.

First, download the most recent version of R at https://www.r-project.org/, . 
Look for the link to download R. Click that download option and you should be taken to CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, and a list of CRAN servers, called mirrors, around the world. Pick a server and choose the precompiled binary distribution for your operating system. Once the file finishes downloading, install it like any other software program – run the .exe for Windows or .pkg for Mac.

Accept all of the default settings for Mac.

Second, install RStudio, an excellent user interface that helps you manage and create R code. Download the open source edition of R Studio desktop and follow the prompts to install it. http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
